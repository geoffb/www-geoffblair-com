While still in the initial stages, we're looking to spend time in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo">Oslo</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergen">Bergen</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troms%C3%B8">Tromsø</a>.</p><p>In Tromsø, we're hoping to be there at the right time for viewing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora">northern lights</a>.</p><p>I intend to post a summary each day, like we did for our <a href="/blog/new-zealand-2014-day-1/">New Zealand trip in 2014</a>.</p><h2>Post once per month</h2><p>I would like to post here more often and once a month seems like an easy bar to hit. One post per month is the floor; hopefully I can post more than that.</p><p>Expect similar content to <a href="/blog/">my existing posts</a>, e.g. <a href="/blog/rain-effect-html5-canvas/">gamedev articles</a>, <a href="/blog/gloomstone-devlog-1/">development logs</a>, <a href="/blog/new-zealand-2014-day-1/">travel</a>, and sometimes <a href="/blog/shining-force-portraits/">art</a>.</p><p>This post takes care of January, at least!</p><h2>Snowboard in Colorado</h2><p>We've lived in Colorado since 2018 and we've yet to hit the local slopes.</p><p>This feels embarrassing as someone who really enjoys snowboarding and was very active in my slightly younger years.</p><p>I'm not much for crowded resorts these days, so I'll be looking for a smaller place - somewhere a little off the beaten path where I won't spend too much time in line for the lifts.</p><h2>Release a game for $1</h2><p>Of all my goals, I'm the most worried about this one!</p><p>I have a few prototypes in the workshop, at varying level of completeness. I'll need to pick something, scope it well, and maintain the motivation/discipline to work on it consistently.</p><p>Why $1? The exact price doesn't matter so much as the process and implications of charging money. I want the game to be finished, polished, and interesting enough that I feel good about attaching a price tag.</p><p>Ideally, this also gives me some grist for the mill in terms of posting each month.</p><h2>Maintain diet and exercise</h2><p>Around July 2023 we started a simple diet and exercise routine: counting calories and walking one mile on as many days as we can.</p><p>Writing down our calorie intake made us more aware of how much we were eating and quickly led to a reduction in calories consumed. I've lost ~35 pounds so far.</p><p>My specific goals for 2024:</p><ul><li>Maintain an intake of 1500-1800 calories per day</li><li>Lose a bit more body fat</li><li>Find a good indoor exercise (Colorado is fairly cold and windy in the winter and outside walks aren't always enjoyable)</li></ul><p>This goal dovetails nicely with our Norway travel plans (several outdoor activities/hikes) and snowboarding, too.</p><h2>Post a 2024 postmortem</h2><p>When setting goals, it only makes sense to measure how much was accomplished.</p><p>I'm reminded of this great quote (which also applies to game development, my health goals, and everything, really):</p><blockquote><p>You can't manage what you don't measure.</p></blockquote><p><a href="/subscribe">Subscribe</a> to follow along and see how this all turns out.</p></main><footer>© Geoff Blair</footer><script defer="defer" src="https://static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js" data-cf-beacon='{"token": "381bc1035c4843a59484ab8f4fdc9311"}'></script></body></html>
