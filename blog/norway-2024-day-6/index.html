We stopped for a few pictures, and had a great chat along the way.</p><p><img src="/media/images/norway2024/scenic-gudvangen-bergen.webp" alt="Looking over the fjords and islands on the drive from Gudvangen to Bergen"></p><p>Once in Bergen, we settled in at our hotel, the Clarion Hotel Admiral. Our room has a balcony facing the water with a fantastic view of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryggen">Bryggen</a> area.</p><p><img src="/media/images/norway2024/bryggen.webp" alt="View of the Bryggen in Bergen from the Clarion Hotel Admiral"></p><p>After checking in we set out on a meandering walk through the city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergen">Bergen</a>. We visited the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergenhus_Fortress">Bergenhus Fortress</a>, many of the iconic shops along the Bryggen, and a few parks within the city.</p><p><img src="/media/images/norway2024/bergen-fountain.webp" alt="A fountain within a park in Bergen"></p><p>We stopped for some food at a street vendor on the docks - Iris had a bowl of their fiskesuppe (no surprise!), and I had a moose burger topped with grilled veggies.</p><p>After a bit more walking, we sat down for a dessert of blueberry cheescake, strawberry cake, and coffee at the <a href="https://www.visitbergen.com/ting-a-gjore/fisketorget-i-bergen-p822253">Fisketorget</a> (fish market).</p><p><img src="/media/images/norway2024/bergen-dessert.webp" alt="Enjoying dessert at the fish market in Bergen"></p><p>Full of sweets and a little exhausted from a day of travel and walking around the city, we returned to the hotel to get some rest for tomorrow's hike in the mountains overlooking Bergen.</p></main><footer>© Geoff Blair</footer><script defer="defer" src="https://static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js" data-cf-beacon='{"token": "381bc1035c4843a59484ab8f4fdc9311"}'></script></body></html>
