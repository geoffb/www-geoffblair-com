Inevitably, I bring up the following quote from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ross">Bob Ross</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Talent is a pursued interest.</p></blockquote><p>I love this quote because it's succinct and gets to the crux of the issue: You must pursue something in order to get better, and you should be interested in that pursuit.</p><p>What we think of as &quot;talent&quot; is a manifested interest in a thing. Interest results in pursuit, and pursuit results in improvement.</p><p>The &quot;interest&quot; can come from a couple angles: You might be inherently interested in the activity, or you might be interested in the end result and disciplined enough to apply pursuit.</p><p>Here's a the quote in context:</p><blockquote><p>One of the most interesting things that we see as we run across the country teaching this fantastic method is people continually say &quot;I can't draw a straight line. I don't have the talent, Bob, to do what you're doing&quot;.</p><p>That's baloney.</p><p>Talent is a pursued interest.</p><p>In other words, anything that you're willing to practice, you can do. And this is no exception.</p><p>But it's like driving a car. At first it's a little difficult. You have to learn how to make your hands and your foots [sic] work together.</p><p>Same thing, and that's what we're trying to teach you here, is the technique.</p><p>Once you have the technique down, all you need is a dream in your heart and the desire to put it on canvas.</p><p>— Bob Ross</p></blockquote></main><footer>© Geoff Blair</footer><script defer="defer" src="https://static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js" data-cf-beacon='{"token": "381bc1035c4843a59484ab8f4fdc9311"}'></script></body></html>
