Since we're traveling quite a bit this year (our planned Norway vacation, an unexpected trip to Spain, and some US travel to see family), I'm looking forward to this &quot;staycation&quot;.</p><p>From a technical standpoint, I'm reusing then engine from my 2023 7DRL entry, <a href="https://gosub.itch.io/jotun-grav">Jotun Grav</a>. 2023 wasn't my best showing - the first year I've marked my entry &quot;incomplete&quot; - in part because I tried to write a new roguelike engine alongside the jam. However, after some massaging and engine feature work in the last year, I feel it's in a pretty good spot for 2024.</p><p>This engine is based on my latest generation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system">ECS architecture</a> (a forthcoming post, perhaps!), is written in <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</a>, and targets the web browser.</p><p>My goal for this year is to make something &quot;better&quot; than <a href="https://gosub.itch.io/catacombs">Catacombs</a> - my 2020 and, subjectively, best entry.</p><p>7DRL allows and encourages rough design ahead of the jam, so I'm planning to go back to my roots with mechanics that involve death.</p><p>Some design elements:</p><ul><li>The player is a Necromancer infiltrating a medieval stronghold (TBD: why?)</li><li>The Necromancer is weak in melee combat, and has a small health pool</li><li>However, the Necromancer can use skills on any corpse found in the world (existing and those of slain enemies)</li></ul><p>Some core Necromancer skills:</p><ul><li>Reanimate: Converts a corpse into a skeleton warrior that fights for the player</li><li>Explode: Causes target corpse to explode, dealing damage to nearby entities</li><li>Harvest: Consumes a corpse to gain &quot;mana&quot;</li></ul><p>My hope is that there's interesting gameplay around managing your &quot;pets&quot; (reanimated skeletons), which act as a proxy for your health pool as well as your body (skeletons might aggro something you didn't want?).</p><p>That about the gist of it - I'm sure things will evolve as I go, and I'll be curious to see how much of the original plans survive the week!</p></main><footer>Â© Geoff Blair</footer><script defer="defer" src="https://static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js" data-cf-beacon='{"token": "381bc1035c4843a59484ab8f4fdc9311"}'></script></body></html>
