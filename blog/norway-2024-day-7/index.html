We were treated to spectacular views of the city below, the surrounding islands of Bergen, and other mountains in the distance.</p><p><img src="/media/images/norway2024/bergen-view.webp" alt="View from Fløyen after exiting the funicular in Bergen, Norway"></p><p>After taking in the views, we started the actual hike further up the mountains. Our guide, Torbjörn (basically &quot;thunder bear&quot; - which is AWESOME) was a fascinating person and we had great conversations. He was particularly interested in American politics/government and we had several long discussions about the differences between Norway and the United States.</p><p>Before we knew it, we made it to the top of the mountain which was sprinkled with some of the first snows of the season; not unlike our home in Colorado where it also begins to snow in October.</p><p>We took a short rest and had the traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kvikk_Lunsj">Kvikk Lunsj</a> (&quot;Quick Lunch&quot;) of chocolate covered wafers (similar to a &quot;Kit-Kat&quot;).</p><p><img src="/media/images/norway2024/bergen-mountain.webp" alt="View from the top of Fløyen mountain in Bergen, Norway"></p><p>On the hike back down, we saw a number of old Norse deities and trolls carved into tree stumps.</p><p><img src="/media/images/norway2024/bergen-face.webp" alt="A carving atop Fløyen in Bergen, Norway"></p><p>Nearing the funicular station, we came across a group of people recreating historical viking life and battles - much like the medieval European &quot;renaissance fairs&quot; we have in the US.</p><p><img src="/media/images/norway2024/bergen-vikings.webp" alt="Locals recreating viking battles atop Fløyen in Bergen, Norway"></p><p>At the station, we said goodbye to Torbjörn and did a bit of souvenir shopping before heading back down into the city.</p><p>After a quick rest at the hotel, we went out to a Mexican restaurant on the docks for some comfort food of enchiladas and tacos.</p><p>We picked up a pastry to share on the way back to the hotel, and turned in for the night to prepare for traveling to Tromsø tomorrow.</p></main><footer>© Geoff Blair</footer><script defer="defer" src="https://static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js" data-cf-beacon='{"token": "381bc1035c4843a59484ab8f4fdc9311"}'></script></body></html>
