The changing leaves with the snowy mountains as a backdrop made for an amazing view.</p><p><img src="/media/images/norway2024/aurland-mountain-waterfall.webp" alt="A waterfall at Aurland mountain in Norway"></p><p>Descending the mountain, we reached the town of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A6rdal">Lærdal</a>. After driving along the river we stopped to visit the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borgund_Stave_Church">Borgund Stave Church</a>, built around 1200 and one of the few remaining stave churches in Norway.</p><p><img src="/media/images/norway2024/borgund-stave-church.webp" alt="The Borgund Stave Church near Lærdal in Norway"></p><p>Getting a bit hungry, we stopped for picnic lunch in a scenic spot along the river with a rocky overhang to keep us dry in the light rain. On the far side of the river was the <a href="https://en.visitbergen.com/things-to-do/the-kings-road-kongevegen-p7213103">&quot;King's Road&quot;</a>, an historic route connecting the east and west sides of Norway.</p><p><img src="/media/images/norway2024/laerdal-picnic.webp" alt="Picnic spot near Lærdal in Norway"></p><p>After lunch, we returned to Aurland via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A6rdal_Tunnel">Lærdal Tunnel</a>, the longest road tunnel in the world.</p><p>Once again we finished the day with an amazing three-course dinner back at 29|2 Aurland - A halibut ceviche appetizer, duck confit main, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilsl%C3%B8rte_bondepiker">Tilslørte bondepiker</a> for dessert.</p></main><footer>© Geoff Blair</footer><script defer="defer" src="https://static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js" data-cf-beacon='{"token": "381bc1035c4843a59484ab8f4fdc9311"}'></script></body></html>
