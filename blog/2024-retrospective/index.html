This makes five years in a row!</p><p>I think it's a pretty strong entry. In many ways it's a step above <a href="https://gosub.itch.io/catacombs">Catacombs</a> (my previous &quot;best&quot; entry, from 2020) which was a sub-goal for this year.</p><p>There's a nice lighting/LOS feature, better procedural dungeon generation, and character skills.</p><p>I wrote about <a href="/blog/7drl-2024/">my plans for the jam</a>, but sadly I did not write a recap afterwards. Something to improve for next year!</p><h3>Travel to Norway</h3><p>Iris and vacationed in Norway in September and it was amazing! I posted a summary of each day we were there, which you can read <a href="/blog/norway-2024-day-1/">starting on the first day</a> (or browse <a href="https://www.geoffblair.com/tags/norway/">all posts tagged #norway</a>).</p><h3>Post once per month</h3><p>While I didn't make a post once each month, I did end up averaging at least a post per month, which counts for something. The Norway blog made up a bulk of my posting so next year I'll need to diversify a bit more and try to post during each month.</p><p>I do have a few drafts sitting unpublished that should have gone out. The upside is that I will have some content ready-ish in the beginning of 2025.</p><h3>Snowboard in Colorado</h3><p>I didn't snowboard in Colorado, or anywhere else. Bummer.</p><p>There's still time this season (in 2025) as Colorado gets snow into April regularly, and sometimes May.</p><p>We'll call this a roll-over goal for 2025.</p><h3>Release a game for $1</h3><p>Another miss! I was worried about this goal when I wrote the roadmap, and for good reason. Completing a game worth selling is a large amount of effort.</p><p>While I did do a bunch of hobby game development in 2024 (more on that in bit), it just wasn't a consolidated and product-focused effort.</p><p>I've still got my eye on this goal, and 2025 might be the year!</p><h3>Maintain diet and exercise</h3><p>I did well on diet and exercise through the first half of the year, but I slipped a bit in the latter half.</p><p>I'm &quot;only&quot; up about 10 pounds - not terrible, but not the direction I was hoping to go.</p><p>All in all, I'm still in better shape than 2023 and ready to get back on the horse for 2025.</p><h3>Post a 2024 Retrospective</h3><p>You are reading it now!</p><h2>What else happened in 2024?</h2><h3>Plato</h3><p>I was fairly busy with Plato work and travel. We've got some cool games and platform features cooking for early next year.</p><p>In April, I traveled with the CEO and CTO to Bilbao, Spain where we met and hung out with several folks from the Plato games team. We all had a blast and ate great food. Iris came along and we got a couple days of sight-seeing in Barcelona as well. (This trip would have made a great post! Maybe I'll still do it.)</p><p>In November, we had the annual Plato Summit in Las Vegas, Nevada. Fun was again had by all, and it was great to see everyone on the team in person.</p><h3>Odin</h3><p>Early in the year, I started learning a new (to me) programming language, <a href="https://odin-lang.org/">Odin</a>. I have a half-done post with more details, and I really enjoyed it.</p><h3>Watt-Wise Game Jam</h3><p>I participated in the first ever <a href="https://wattwise.games/">Watt-Wise Game Jam</a>, hosted by my friend and co-worker Chris Waldon and friends.</p><p>My entry was an old school first-person dungeon crawler, <a href="https://gosub.itch.io/green-rpg">Green RPG</a>. It's fairly slight since the timing of the jam came between 7DRL and my Plato Spain trip, and I got distracted halfway through by Odin.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>All in all, 2024 was a good year.</p><p>I think I did well on my goals and I have some clear goals going into my roadmap for next year. I left some opportunities for posting on the table and I mean to correct that in 2025.</p><p>Happy new year!</p></main><footer>Â© Geoff Blair</footer><script defer="defer" src="https://static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js" data-cf-beacon='{"token": "381bc1035c4843a59484ab8f4fdc9311"}'></script></body></html>
