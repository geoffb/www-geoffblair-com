Hiking only partway up due to time constraints, we still got to see great views of Tromsø.</p><p><img src="/media/images/norway2024/tromso-view.webp" alt="View of Tromsø from Sherpatrappa in Tromsdalen, Norway"></p><p>Since we had a ferry to catch later, we headed back down the trail and across the bridge to eat lunch. Given the limited options, we again ate at Egon, but with comfort food and wifi it was a nice meal.</p><p>We stopped at a few shops along the way back to our hotel to pick up our luggage before heading over to the ferry dock to catch our boat over to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finnsnes">Finnsnes</a>. The express boat ride was a quick one across the rainy fjord and we were met by a driver who then took us from Finnsnes to our hotel, <a href="https://www.hamnisenja.no">Hamn i Senja</a>.</p><p>Hamn i Senja is a very nice resort with amazing cottages that overlook the sea and have large north-facing windows for viewing of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora">northern lights</a>.</p><p><img src="/media/images/norway2024/hamn-i-senja.webp" alt="Hamn i Senja cottages along the sea in Senja, Norway"></p><p>Being fairly remote, the only option for dinner was the attached restaurant, which had some great food. Iris tried their fiskesuppe while I had panfried cod with bacon mashed potatoes.</p><p>The resort includes a small lighthouse offering panoramic views of the area while enjoying hot coffee. We spent some of the evening after dinner in the lighthouse hoping to see the aurora, but because of the rain and clouds we couldn't see anything spectacular. We're hopeful for better views over the next couple of nights.</p></main><footer>© Geoff Blair</footer><script defer="defer" src="https://static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js" data-cf-beacon='{"token": "381bc1035c4843a59484ab8f4fdc9311"}'></script></body></html>
