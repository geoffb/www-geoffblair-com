For more context, check out the <a href="/blog/new-zealand-2014-day-1/">first day</a> or the <a href="/blog/new-zealand-2014-day-7/">previous day</a>.</em></p><p>Today was another travel day as we flew from Dunedin to Auckland. This also marks the end of our travels in the South Island and the final leg of our trip.</p><p>We arrived in Auckland around noon, greeted by rainy weather and lots of traffic. Luckily, we had arranged for a ride from the airport to our accomodations, the Heritage Hotel.</p><p>Our room was pretty amazing at least. High on the seventh floor we had a great view of the city, a separate sitting area, and kitchen.</p><p><a href="/media/images/nz14/day8/heritage-hotel.jpg"><img src="/media/images/nz14/day8/thumb-heritage-hotel.jpg" alt="Our room at the Heritage Hotel, Auckland"></a></p><p>Ravenous with hunger, we braved the rain and found a sports bar near the harbor where we scarfed down a couple burgers. Also, cricket remains a baffling sport.</p><p>We returned to the hotel to relax and plan out the remainder of our trip. Feeling extra lazy (also rain!), we ordered pizza and watched Australian and New Zealand cooking shows in the evening.</p><p><a href="/media/images/nz14/day8/auckland.jpg"><img src="/media/images/nz14/day8/thumb-auckland.jpg" alt="View of Auckland from Heritage Hotel"></a></p><p>The weather in Auckland should improve tomorrow, just in time for our outdoor activities!</p><p><em>For more New Zealand adventures, check out the <a href="/blog/new-zealand-2014-day-9/">next day</a>.</em></p></main><footer>Â© Geoff Blair</footer></body></html>
