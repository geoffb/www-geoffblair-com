Knowing that we'd be on the train for several hours, we got a to-go box with meat, cheese, and some pastries from the buffet.</p><p>After breakfast we took the short walk across the street to the sentralstasjon to catch the train to <a href="https://en.visitbergen.com/things-to-do/norway-fjords/myrdal-norway-all-you-need-to-know-before-visiting">Myrdal</a>. The ride was nice, and we had great views of the countryside. Myrdal is a small station that connects to the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fl%C3%A5m_Line">Flåm Railway</a> which is considered one of the best train trips in the world, and for good reason!</p><p><img src="/media/images/norway2024/myrdal-station.webp" alt="Waiting for the Flåm Railway train at Myrdal station in Norway"></p><p>On board the train to Flåm, we were treated with spectacular views of the valley and mountains - pictures just don't do it justice. The rocky cliffs shrouded in fog, numerous waterfalls, deep valleys, and quaint villages lining the rivers were all breathtaking.</p><p><img src="/media/images/norway2024/flam-railway.webp" alt="A waterfall along the Flåm Railway in Norway"></p><p>Once we arrived in Flåm, we were picked up at the station and driven to <a href="https://www.292aurland.com">29|2 Aurland</a> where we'll be staying for the next few days. After a quick tour of the grounds and a nice salad for lunch, we headed out for a short hike to a nearby waterfall.</p><p><img src="/media/images/norway2024/aurland-waterfall.webp" alt="A waterfall near Aurland in Norway"></p><p>Continuing up the hillside, we stopped for some spectacular views of the valley below.</p><p><img src="/media/images/norway2024/aurland-hike.webp" alt="Overlooking the valley near Aurland in Norway"></p><p>Returning to the lodge, we rested for a bit before dinner time. Dinner was an amazing three-course meal: Cold potato and leek soup to start (my personal favorite so far), followed by a main of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hake">Hake</a> with peas and burnt tomato sauce, and capped off with chocolate fudge cake with cream and coffee drizzle for dessert.</p><p><img src="/media/images/norway2024/aurland-dinner.webp" alt="Cold potato and leek soup at 29|2 Aurland in Norway"></p><p>It was an eventful and exhausting day (in a good way) and we're looking forward to more activities around Aurland over the next few days.</p></main><footer>© Geoff Blair</footer><script defer="defer" src="https://static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js" data-cf-beacon='{"token": "381bc1035c4843a59484ab8f4fdc9311"}'></script></body></html>
