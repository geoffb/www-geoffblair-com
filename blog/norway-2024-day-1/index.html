Talking with our driver, we learned various tidbits about Norway, including that barns and storehouses were traditionally painted red, as that was a cheaper color, while residences were painted the more expensive white.</p><p>We are staying in the <a href="https://amerikalinjen.com">Amerikalinjen</a> hotel for a couple of nights, which is located near the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Central_Station">&quot;Oslo sentralstasjon&quot;</a> (Central train station).</p><p><img src="/media/images/norway2024/amerikalinjen.webp" alt="Amerikalinjen Hotel in Oslo, Norway"></p><p>After checking in, we set out on foot to explore the city a bit. Walking down <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Johans_gate">Karl Johans gate</a>, we took note of interesting shops and restaurants to visit later. In particular, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freia_(chocolate)">Freia</a> chocolate shop!</p><p><img src="/media/images/norway2024/karl-johans-gate.webp" alt="Looking down Karl Johans gate in Olso, Norway"></p><p>Getting hungry, we ate at the Royal Gastropub near the sentralstasjon.
