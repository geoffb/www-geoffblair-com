These farms sit high up the mountain in order to get sun as the steep cliffs of the fjords generally shade the valley below.</p><p>We took a nice hike with Gry up to one of her various cabins within the mountains.</p><p><img src="/media/images/norway2024/aurland-cabin.webp" alt="Farm cabins in the Aurland mountains"></p><p>Inside the small cabin, we had coffee and Gry cooked up delicious surmelkslapper (sour cream &quot;pancakes&quot;) while she told us all about life on her multigenerational farm. It was fascinating to hear her stories and the ins and outs of making and selling goat cheese, lamb meat, and wool.</p><p><img src="/media/images/norway2024/aurland-cabin-pancakes.webp" alt="Drinking coffee and eating surmelkslapper with Gry in her cabin"></p><p>We spent a few hours with Gry talking and hiking, after which we said goodbye.</p><p>Since it was such a beautiful day, we took the opportunity to head up to the Stegastein viewpoint again - this time with a clear and amazing view of the fjord.</p><p><img src="/media/images/norway2024/stegastein.webp" alt="Overlooking the fjord from Steagstein viewpoint"></p><p>We found a nice spot above the viewpoint to eat our packed lunch before heading back down the mountain into the town of Aurland. We spent an hour or so walking around the town and pier and did a bit of gift shopping at local retailers.</p><p><img src="/media/images/norway2024/aurland-pier.webp" alt="Walking along the Aurland pier"></p><p>It didn't take long to see most of the small town and afterwards we took a nice walk back to 29|2 Aurland where we jumped into the outdoor hot tub to relax and unwind while taking in views of the mountains and waterfalls.</p><p>We again finished up the day with superb dinner in the lodge - delicious hake and a brown butter parfait for desert.</p><p><em><a href="/blog/norway-2024-day-6/">Continue to day 6</a> or browse <a href="/tags/norway/">all posts tagged #norway</a>.</em></p></main><footer>Â© Geoff Blair</footer><script defer="defer" src="https://static.cloudflareinsights.com/beacon.min.js" data-cf-beacon='{"token": "381bc1035c4843a59484ab8f4fdc9311"}'></script></body></html>
