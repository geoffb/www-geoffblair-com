# üïπÔ∏è Games

A sampling of games I've created, either alone, with friends, or as part of a company.

## Plato

[Plato](https://www.platoapp.com) is a messenger app with embedded games. My code touches most of the games on the platform in one way or another. Specific games I've worked on are Ocho, Literati, and Baloot.

## Lost Decade Games

Games created under the [Lost Decade Games](http://www.lostdecadegames.com) banner, with [Matt Hackett](http://www.richtaur.com) and [Joshua Morse](http://jmflava.com/#/welcome).
