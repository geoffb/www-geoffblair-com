# üßëüèª‚Äçüíª Uses

What I use to get the job done. Inspired by [Uses This](https://usesthis.com).

## Who are you, and what do you do?

I make [games](/games/) and things for the web. See more [about me](/about/).

## What hardware do you use?

My primary machine is an [iMac Pro (2017)](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP771?locale=en_US).

When not at my desk, I use a [MacBook Air (M2, 2022)](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP869?locale=en_US) with the Midnight finish.

## And what software?

I mostly write code in [Nova](https://nova.app) and sometimes [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) is my entry point into everything, including API documentation lookup via [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash).
