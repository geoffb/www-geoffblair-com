As a big fan of "roguelite" games ([Spelunky](https://spelunkyworld.com), [Dead Cells](https://dead-cells.com), [Invisible, Inc.](https://www.klei.com/games/invisible-inc), and [Intro the Breach](http://subsetgames.com/itb.html) are a few of my favorites), I've often appreciated more traditional roguelikes; even though I don't play them quite as much.

Likewise, the [7DRL game jam](https://7drl.com) has long been on my radar and it's high time I used it as excuse to make a roguelike game for [this year's challenge](https://itch.io/jam/7drl-challenge-2020).

My general plan is to make something relatively traditional (turn-based, etc), and explore the permadeath mechanic in ways inspired by [A Wizard's Lizard](http://www.wizardslizard.com).

I'll host the game itself on [my itch.io page](https://gosub.itch.io), and _attempt_ to post a short update on this blog each day.

Since the schedule is timezone-friendly, I'm noting my start time here (~3pm MST) with a deadline for myself of ~3pm MST next Saturday.

Ship it!
