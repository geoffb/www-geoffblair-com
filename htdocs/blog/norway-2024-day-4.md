Today we continued our outdoor adventures around Aurland.

We started off with a good breakfast at the 29|2 Aurland lodge, consisting of eggs, bacon, fresh bread, smoked fish, cheese, and other tasty items.

After breakfast we set out with our guide up Aurlandsfjellet (Aurland mountains).

We stopped at the [Stegastein viewpoint](https://en.visitbergen.com/things-to-do/norway-fjords/stegastein-viewpoint-near-flam-with-spectacular-fjord-views), but because of the rainy and foggy weather we weren't able to get a clear view of the fjord below.

Continuing up the mountains, we reached the snow covered plateau with many small lakes amongst the peaks.

Heading down the other side of the mountains, we stopped for a short hike to a nearby waterfall. The changing leaves with the snowy mountains as a backdrop made for an amazing view.

Descending the mountain, we reached the town of [Lærdal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lærdal). After driving along the river we stopped to visit the [Borgund Stave Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borgund_Stave_Church), built around 1200 and one of the few remaining stave churches in Norway.

Getting a bit hungry, we stopped for picnic lunch in a scenic spot along the river with a rocky overhang to keep us dry in the light rain. On the far side of the river was the ["King's Road"](https://en.visitbergen.com/things-to-do/the-kings-road-kongevegen-p7213103), an historic route connecting the east and west sides of Norway.

After lunch, we returned to Aurland via the [Lærdal Tunnel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lærdal_Tunnel), the longest road tunnel in the world.

Once again we finished the day with an amazing three-course dinner back at 29|2 Aurland - A halibut ceviche appetizer, duck confit main, and [Tilslørte bondepiker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilslørte_bondepiker) for dessert.
