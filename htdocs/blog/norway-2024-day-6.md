Today we said goodbye to Aurland and traveled from Fl책m to Bergen.

We woke up early to eat our final breakfast at 29|2 Aurland, thanked the staff for an amazing time, and headed out for the quick drive to Fl책m in order to catch the ferry to [Gudvangen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gudvangen).

The ferry ride through the fjord was spectacular!

The fjord was dotted with several charming villages and farms along the coastline.

Arriving in Gudvangen, we met up with our driver, Gerald, and set out on the scenic ~2.5 drive to Bergen along the fjords. We stopped for a few pictures, and had a great chat along the way.

Once in Bergen, we settled in at our hotel, the Clarion Hotel Admiral. Our room has a balcony facing the water with a fantastic view of the [Bryggen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryggen) area.

After checking in we set out on a meandering walk through the city of [Bergen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergen). We visited the [Bergenhus Fortress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergenhus_Fortress), many of the iconic shops along the Bryggen, and a few parks within the city.

We stopped for some food at a street vendor on the docks - Iris had a bowl of their fiskesuppe (no surprise!), and I had a moose burger topped with grilled veggies.

After a bit more walking, we sat down for a dessert of blueberry cheescake, strawberry cake, and coffee at the [Fisketorget](https://www.visitbergen.com/ting-a-gjore/fisketorget-i-bergen-p822253) (fish market).

Full of sweets and a little exhausted from a day of travel and walking around the city, we returned to the hotel to get some rest for tomorrow's hike in the mountains overlooking Bergen.
