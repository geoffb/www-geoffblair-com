Today were supposed to head out for wildlife sightseeing by boat in the morning, but due to extreme winds and weather the trip was canceled.

The wind was so strong we had to struggle to walk to the main lodge for breakfast.

In spite of the nasty weather, we had a nice day relaxing in our cozy room after breakfast. I was able to catch up on these blog posts and we had a nice midday nap.

It's tough to tell from the photos, but the wind was absolutely howling and it was raining / hailing on and off.

All in all, it was nice to have some downtime after lots of hiking and outdoor activities in the past week.

In the evening we went down to the restaurant for dinner and then headed back to our room to hang out and watch for the northern lights.

We stayed up late looking towards the north, but the stormy weather and clouds predictably put a damper on our views for tonight. We still have tomorrow night, so we're keeping our fingers crossed for better weather!
