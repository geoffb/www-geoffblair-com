Today we traveled from Oslo to [Flåm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flåm) via train, and then to [Aurland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurland).

We started out the day with another breakfast at the Amerikalinjen hotel. Knowing that we'd be on the train for several hours, we got a to-go box with meat, cheese, and some pastries from the buffet.

After breakfast we took the short walk across the street to the sentralstasjon to catch the train to [Myrdal](https://en.visitbergen.com/things-to-do/norway-fjords/myrdal-norway-all-you-need-to-know-before-visiting). The ride was nice, and we had great views of the countryside. Myrdal is a small station that connects to the famous [Flåm Railway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flåm_Line) which is considered one of the best train trips in the world, and for good reason!

On board the train to Flåm, we were treated with spectacular views of the valley and mountains - pictures just don't do it justice. The rocky cliffs shrouded in fog, numerous waterfalls, deep valleys, and quaint villages lining the rivers were all breathtaking.

Once we arrived in Flåm, we were picked up at the station and driven to [29|2 Aurland](https://www.292aurland.com) where we'll be staying for the next few days. After a quick tour of the grounds and a nice salad for lunch, we headed out for a short hike to a nearby waterfall.

Continuing up the hillside, we stopped for some spectacular views of the valley below.

Returning to the lodge, we rested for a bit before dinner time. Dinner was an amazing three-course meal: Cold potato and leek soup to start (my personal favorite so far), followed by a main of [Hake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hake) with peas and burnt tomato sauce, and capped off with chocolate fudge cake with cream and coffee drizzle for dessert.

It was an eventful and exhausting day (in a good way) and we're looking forward to more activities around Aurland over the next few days.
