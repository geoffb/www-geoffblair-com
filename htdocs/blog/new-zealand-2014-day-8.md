*This is a series of posts chronicling our New Zealand trip. For more context, check out the [first day][first] or the [previous day][prev].*

Today was another travel day as we flew from Dunedin to Auckland. This also marks the end of our travels in the South Island and the final leg of our trip.

We arrived in Auckland around noon, greeted by nasty weather and lots of traffic.
