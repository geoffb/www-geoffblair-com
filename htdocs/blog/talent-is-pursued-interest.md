I often find myself talking to others (and reminding myself!) about how to get better at doing things. Inevitably, I bring up the following quote from [Bob Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ross):

> Talent is a pursued interest.

I love this quote because it's succinct and gets to the crux of the issue: You must pursue something in order to get better, and you should be interested in that pursuit.

What we think of as "talent" is a manifested interest in a thing. Interest results in pursuit, and pursuit results in improvement.

The "interest" can come from a couple angles: You might be inherently interested in the activity, or you might be interested in the end result and disciplined enough to apply pursuit.

Here's a the quote in context:

> One of the most interesting things that we see as we run across the country teaching this fantastic method is people continually say "I can't draw a straight line. I don't have the talent, Bob, to do what you're doing".
>
> That's baloney.
>
> Talent is a pursued interest.
>
> In other words, anything that you're willing to practice, you can do. And this is no exception.
>
> But it's like driving a car. At first it's a little difficult. You have to learn how to make your hands and your foots [sic] work together.
>
> Same thing, and that's what we're trying to teach you here, is the technique.
>
> Once you have the technique down, all you need is a dream in your heart and the desire to put it on canvas.
