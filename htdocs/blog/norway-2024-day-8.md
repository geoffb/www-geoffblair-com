Today we traveled from Bergen to [Tromsø](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tromsø) to continue our adventures in the even northern parts of Norway.

We got up early to pack and eat breakfast before heading out. The morning view of the Bryggen area from our hotel was magical. The lights going up the mountain are the [funicular route we took yesterday](/blog/norway-2024-day-7/).

After a short ride to the Bergen airport, and a smooth two hour flight, we landed in Tromsø.

We checked in to the Clarion Hotel The Edge and walked around downtown a bit, but since it was a cold and rainy Sunday evening there wasn't much going on. With limited dining options, we ate at the Egon restaurant, a chain with a large menu and pretty decent food, before calling it a night.
