We made it to [Oslo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo), [Norway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway)! ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´

We arrived at the Oslo Gardermoen airport and met up with our driver for the ~40 minute ride from the airport into Oslo. Talking with our driver, we learned various tidbits about Norway, including that barns and storehouses were traditionally painted red, as that was a cheaper color, while residences were painted the more expensive white.

We are staying in the [Amerikalinjen](https://amerikalinjen.com) hotel for a couple of nights, which is located near the ["Oslo sentralstasjon"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Central_Station) (Central train station).

After checking in, we set out on foot to explore the city a bit. Walking down [Karl Johans gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Johans_gate), we took note of interesting shops and restaurants to visit later. In particular, the [Freia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freia_(chocolate)>) chocolate shop!

Getting hungry, we ate at the Royal Gastropub near the sentralstasjon. We returned to the hotel for an early night as we were tired from the long day of travel.

We're looking forward to experiencing more of Oslo tomorrow!
