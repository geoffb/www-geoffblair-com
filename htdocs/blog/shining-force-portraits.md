As a big fan of [Shining Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shining_Force), I took a stab at drawing the [character portraits](http://fantasyanime.com/shiningforce/sflist.htm) back in early 2016.

Portraits were drawn on my Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge in [SketchBook by Autodesk](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adsk.sketchbook&hl=en) using a cheap touch pen.

Overall I'm pretty happy with the style and results. However, drawing eyes seems to be an area for improvement.

I had intended to complete the entire set, but motivation lacks and life happens!

Maybe I'll finish them one day.
