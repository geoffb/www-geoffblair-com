Limited time today so here's a quick run-down of what changed:

- Added food items to the game which can only be collected while alive
- Added pots and chests which contain randomized loot drops (hearts, food items, keys, etc)
- A bunch of work on level design

Give the [latest build](https://gosub.itch.io/catacombs) a try!
