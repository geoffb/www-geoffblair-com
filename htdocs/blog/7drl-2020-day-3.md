Day 3 progress on my 7DRL 2020 game:

Limited time today so here's a quick run-down of what changed:
* Added food items to the game which can only be collected while alive
* Added pots and chests which contain randomized loot drops (hearts, food items, keys, etc)
* A bunch of work on level design

Give the [latest build](https://gosub.itch.io/7drl-2020) a try!
