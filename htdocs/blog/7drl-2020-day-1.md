Day 1 progress on my 7DRL 2020 game:

I had an existing turn-based tile engine prototype collecting dust, so I started with that as a base. The graphics are from [Kenney's 1-Bit Pack](https://kenney.nl/assets/bit-pack).

![Cemetery](/media/images/7drl2020/cemetery.png)

You start off as a skeleton, in a static cemetery "intro" floor. In the cemetery is an exit to the procedurally generated crypt. As you descend, new floors are (dumbly) generated. You can traverse back up to previously generated floors, which retain their state as you left them.

As of now, you can descend floors forever, but there's not much else to do. :)
