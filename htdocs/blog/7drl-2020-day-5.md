A cool new feature landed today: **Affixes**!

![Combustible affix](/media/images/7drl2020/day5-a.png)

Affixes are floor-wide modifiers which, when active, increase the difficulty in some way. Two affixes currently exist:

- **Combustible**: Monsters burst into flame when the die, leaving a hazard behind for several turns
- **Vengeful**: Monsters leave behind a vengeful ghost when they die

Affixes are currently applied every so many floors and are announced via some flavor text.

Other changes of note:

- Skeleton form can no longer benefit from Heart pickups; in fact it's best to avoid them...
- When Human form reaches 0 Food (aka starving) they no longer lose 1HP each step. Instead, a forced resource trade is made of 1HP for 25 food.
- Sounds! Added a few sounds here and there. More to come. (HTML5 Audio objects seem to cause bad lag in Safari, so consider another browser)
- Next up on the agenda is pivoting to content: Adding more floors, variations, monsters, trap, affixes, etc.
