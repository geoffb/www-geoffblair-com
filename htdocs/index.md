# 👋🏻 Hi, I'm Geoff

I'm a game developer (sometimes indie, sometimes not), focused on web technologies.

I'm currently working on [Plato](https://www.platoapp.com), a messenger + games app.

I occasionally write about game development, running a small business, and my travels.

Find out more [about me][1].
