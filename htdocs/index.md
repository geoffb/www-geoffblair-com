# 👋🏻 Hi, I'm Geoff

I'm a [game developer](/games/) (sometimes indie, sometimes not), focused on web technologies.

I'm currently working on [Plato](https://www.platoapp.com), a messenger + games app.

I occasionally write about game development, traveling, and other topics.

Find out more [about me](/about/).
