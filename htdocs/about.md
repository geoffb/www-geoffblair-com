# üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

I'm a [game developer](/games/) and co-founder of [Lost Decade Games][1]. I currently reside in the Colorado Springs area with my wife, Melissa Iris, and our cats.

After spending nearly a decade as a full stack web developer at companies such as [Yahoo! Games][4] and [Raptr][5], I decided to focus on my lifelong obsession with game development by founding [Lost Decade Games][1] with [Matt Hackett][6] in 2010.

When not stuck behind a computer screen, I like to [snowboard][7], [travel][10], and [play board games][11].

For a more professional look, see [my resume][9].
