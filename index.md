Hello!

My name is Geoff. I love [treasure][1]. I live in the San Francisco bay area with my girlfriend, Melissa, and our three cats.

There's not much here because I spend all my time working on my HTML5 game studio, [Lost Decade Games][2], which I co-founded with [Matt Hackett][7].

Still reading? OK. Here's a JavaScript/DOM game I made called [Shapes][3]. I also made this nifty [HTML5 logo in JavaScript][4].

In case you hadn't noticed, I make things on the web for a living (and for recreation). Mostly [games][6] these days.

Before starting [LDG][2], I used to write JavaScript/HTML/web apps for [Game Closure][8], [Raptr][9], [Yahoo! Games][10], [Overnight Prints][11] and [Data Strategies][12].

Sometimes I leave the house and go [snowboarding][5] or hiking.

Follow me on [Twitter][13] and [GitHub][14] or drop me an [email][15].
