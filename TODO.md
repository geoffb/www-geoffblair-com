# TODO

## Engine

- Version static assets (like CSS bundles)
- Style block quotes nicely
- Support draft posts (publish in dev, not in prod)
- JavaScript templates? (Like Less, but JS + esbuild -> JS bundle)
- Lazy load images
- Improve image optimization (might be an 11ty solution)
- Template for "Day N" post series with previous/next/etc, e.g. New Zealand and Norway travel, or game jam devlogs

## Content

- Create a `/now` page (what I'm doing "now", see: https://nownownow.com/about)
- Add `/humans.txt` (see: https://humanstxt.org)
- Donâ€™t embed GitHub content?
- Fix rain demo embedded script
- Migrate devlog posts from itch.io
- Embed web games from itch.io (publish here as source of truth aka POSSE)
